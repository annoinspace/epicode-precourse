        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>I was born in Manchester, UK, and I have lived here most of my life! I have a degree in Interior Design as I enjoy both technical and artistic fields. 
            For the past 2 years I have run my own bakery business, and I am now ready for a new and exciting career since I have always had an interest in coding and more widely, tech.</p>
